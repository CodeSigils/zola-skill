# Bounded accessibility review

Read this for an accessibility review of an existing Zola site's content,
templates, generated pages, media, CSS, or theme overrides. It supports
concrete static findings; it does not establish WCAG conformance, test
assistive technology, or authorize a redesign.

## Inspect source and generated output

1. Inspect the source and rendered pages in scope. Identify meaningful page
   regions using semantic elements where the page has navigation, main content,
   headers, or footers; do not add ARIA roles without a repository-specific
   need.
2. Check that headings describe the page's organization and follow a logical
   hierarchy. Report a skipped level only when the rendered structure makes the
   section relationship unclear.
3. Check each changed or in-scope image by purpose: informative images need a
   concise alternative that conveys essential information, decorative images
   need `alt=""`, and an image functioning as a link or button needs an
   alternative that describes that action.
4. Check that each in-scope link communicates its destination or action through
   its text or directly associated context. Do not call a short link defective
   when the rendered context demonstrably supplies its purpose.
5. For video/audio/iframes, check a descriptive iframe title, controls,
   captions, transcripts or equivalent alternatives, and a fallback when an
   external provider is unavailable. For CSS/theme changes, inspect focus,
   contrast, zoom/reflow, color independence, and reduced-motion behavior when
   the evidence permits.

## Report limits precisely

Use the review finding format from
[the modification/review workflow](../workflows/modify-review.md). Include the
rendered path and exact markup as evidence, plus the validation used after a
repair. State which of keyboard behavior, focus treatment, contrast, responsive
layout, media alternatives, assistive-technology behavior, and conformance
level were not assessed unless the request and evidence specifically cover
them.

## Source boundary

Use the W3C WAI and WCAG rows in the [source registry](source-registry.md).
Prefer native HTML and visible names before ARIA; these sources support bounded
checks, not a universal ARIA pattern or a compliance certification.

Accessible structure and useful text alternatives can also improve discoverability
and user experience, but accessibility review is not an SEO audit and must not
be reduced to keyword or ranking advice.
